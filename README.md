# Algorithms Practice

I will be using this repository to create problems solved by variations of common algorithms.

## Binary Search

This file creates a list of random length (up to len 13), adds random ints (up to 13) and sorts the list. The list is then rotated a random number of times by popping and appending the first value in the list a random number of times.
The search function determines the position of the lowest number in the list.

## Linked List

This file is just a collection of basic linked list methods and an implementation of a linked list structure.

## Tree and Binary Search tree

In these files I implement trees as well as binary search trees and some useful methods

## Arrays

Some exercises with dynamic arrays (i.e. lists in Python)

## Hash Table

I implement a Hash Table class (that mimics the functionality of a Dict which is a built-in Hash Table structure in Python) with a very simple hash function. Collisions are handled by chaining, not linear probing.

## Queues and Stacks

I implement stacks and queues using deques (and lists) as well as a few methods that allow me to perform some simple operations
