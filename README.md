####Algorithms Practice

I will be using this repository to create problems solved by variations of common algorithms.

##Binary Search

This file creates a list of random length (up to len 13), adds random ints (up to 13) and sorts the list. The list is then rotated a random number of times by popping and appending the first value in the list a random number of times.
The search function determines the position of the lowest number in the list.
